I like to make video clips with Matlab for some visualization. However, to publish it with a `.mp4` format is not always a good idea.

It would be much easy to insert `.gif` files in a web-page.

Here's the way to convert `.mp4` files into `.gif` using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/).

First, change directory to the location of the `.mp4` file. For example,
```
cd /Users/roy/Documents/MATLAB/fun
```

Create a new folder to store the temporary files.
```
mkdir frames
```

Next, extract images from video, 
```
ffmpeg -i waveInterference.mp4  -r 20 'frames/frame-%03d.jpg'
```
where `-r 20` stands for 20 frames per second (fps), and `%03d` is the regular rule for naming: integer number with 3 field width, and padding to field width with zeros before the value.

At last, convert image to gif,
```
cd frames
convert -delay 5 -loop 0 *.jpg waveInterference.gif
```
`-delay 5` means the time between each frame is 0.05 seconds, which match 20 fps above (in general 100/delay = fps). `-loop 0` means repeat forever.

Most of the time, the `.gif` file created this way is with big size, and you could optimize the frames following the manual here, [Optimize gif frame](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/anim_opt/).

This is the example I made illustrating two wave interference. Converted from the original `Mathematica` code to `Matlab`.
![two wave interference](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fvevhs0qhlg30go08s4qq.gif)

code here:
``` Matlab
nPoints = 2^7;
x = linspace(0, 16, nPoints);
y = linspace(-8, 8, nPoints);
[X, Y] = meshgrid(x, y);

nLoop = 2^4;
t = linspace(0, 1, nLoop);

fig = figure();
writer = VideoWriter('waveInterference.mp4', 'MPEG-4');
writer.FrameRate = 10;
open(writer);

for iL = 1 : nLoop
    eField = sin(2*pi*(sqrt(X.^2 + (Y-4).^2) - t(iL))) ...
    + sin(2*pi*(sqrt(X.^2 + (Y+4).^2) - t(iL)));
    pcolor(X, Y, eField)
    axis off
    shading interp
    colormap(gray)
    frame = getframe(fig);
    writeVideo(writer, frame);
end
close(writer);
```
