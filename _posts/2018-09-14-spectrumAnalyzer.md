Today, a problem raises for discussion in the office. For a set of pulse train, typically we think that the response on the spectrum analyzer reflects the repetition rate. As a result, the strongest signal locates around the fundamental repetition rate.

Problem is, why there's so many higher order harmonics and what's the temporal characteristics corresponding to those high harmonics signal.

Literally, I guess there's a misunderstanding here. We typically use the spectrum analyzer to detect the fundamental repetition rate, which does not mean that it only reflects the repetition rate.

From the perspective of frequency composition, a single frequency without any higher harmonics corresponds to an ideal sinusoid signal. Of course, the pulses in the pulse train does not exhibit a sinusoid-like shape. That's why we always say if you want to compose a signal with complicated shape, you should take as many frequencies as possible. To
